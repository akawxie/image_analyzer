Project Name: Image Analyzer
Version: 1.0
Document Date: 2024-11-03
Status: Draft

1. Core Functionalities

	•	Image Upload and Display
	•	Enable users to upload images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
	•	Display uploaded images in the dialog area with the file name beneath each image, maintaining a clean and borderless look.
	•	Prompt Input and Display
	•	Allow users to enter custom prompts or select from preset prompts.
	•	Display each prompt in the dialog area beneath the associated image, consecutively and in the order submitted. Preset prompts should appear only in the dialog, not the input box.
	•	Preset Prompts and Button Layout
	•	Show preset prompts as clickable buttons above the input box in a grid layout (two buttons per row).
	•	Enable prompt submission with a single click for preset options.
	•	Model Integration:
	•	Use the “llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview” model from GroqCloud for processing images and prompts.
	•	API Documentation: The development team should review GroqCloud’s API documentation to understand request structure and response handling.
	•	API Key: The developer should provide the necessary API key to connect to GroqCloud.
	•	Process Flow:
	•	Images and prompts will be sent directly to the model without intermediate storage.
	•	The model’s responses should be formatted for immediate display in the frontend, ensuring a quick, efficient analysis.
	•	Node.js Compatibility Check
	•	Ensure compatibility with Node.js v18.17.0 or above, setting up nvm to use Node.js v18 as the default.

2. User Experience (UX) Improvements

	•	Layout and Spacing
	•	Add padding in the dialog area for a clear, organized layout.
	•	Align image names and prompt text cohesively under each image.
	•	Colors and Typography
	•	Adopt a consistent, professional color scheme with neutral tones.
	•	Use a clean sans-serif font with bolded or larger text where emphasis is needed.
	•	Button Interactivity and Placement
	•	Place the “Upload” button on the left and the “Send” button on the right in the input area.
	•	Add hover effects to preset prompt buttons for interactive feedback.

3. Technical Requirements

	•	Dependencies
	•	Ensure the application is compatible with Node.js v18.17.0 or above.
	•	Set up nvm instructions for universally setting Node.js v18 as the default version.
	•	Model Access:
	•	Follow GroqCloud’s API documentation for interacting with the “llama-3.2-11b-vision-preview” model.
	•	Use the provided API key securely to authenticate requests.

4. Future Improvements

	•	Gradio Integration: Explore Gradio for potential interactive or AI-driven components.
	•	Advanced Image Analysis: Consider adding more AI-based image analysis features based on user demand and GroqCloud’s model capabilities.
